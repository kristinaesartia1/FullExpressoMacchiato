## Usage

Once your application is running, you can access the API endpoints and utilize the features provided by **FullExpressoMacchiato**. Here’s a quick overview of how to interact with the API:

### CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Send a POST request to `/api/resource` with the required data in the request body.
- **Read**: Send a GET request to `/api/resource` to retrieve all resources or `/api/resource/:id` to retrieve a specific resource.
- **Update**: Send a PUT request to `/api/resource/:id` with the updated data in the request body.
- **Delete**: Send a DELETE request to `/api/resource/:id` to remove a specific resource.

### Authentication

To access protected routes, you must include a token in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Swagger UI

To view the API documentation, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`. This will display the Swagger UI, where you can explore the available endpoints and test them directly.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated and served through Swagger UI. You can find it at the following link: [API Documentation](http://localhost:3000/api-docs).

For a comprehensive understanding of the API endpoints, refer to the Swagger UI interface. It provides detailed information about each endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and examples.
